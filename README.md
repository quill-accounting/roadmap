# Quill public roadmap

:sparkle: View the
[official public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/quill-accounting/projects/2)[^1]

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on,
what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any
questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via
[public feedback discussions](https://github.com/quill-accounting/feedback/discussions).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the
following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap
  item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item
  belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the
  roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the
  relevant [Changelog](https://quill.cy/changelog/) post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through,
from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** _Primarily for testing and feedback_\
  Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy
  development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation,
  SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** _Publicly available in full or limited capacity_\
  Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually
  published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** _Generally available to all customers_\
  Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations.
  Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no
timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback.
These are marked as follows:

- **in design:**\
  Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still
  figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
  Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering
  feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each
item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular
project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship
next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is
subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an
**Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and
**exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **documents:** Document scanning, OCR, and document management
- **artificial-intelligence:** Matching, reconciliation, and other AI features
- **invoices:** Invoicing features
- **vendors:** Vendor management features
- **other:** Other features
